Run the following command to generate the documentation:

$ ./generate.py

It requires:
- Python 2.4
- Docutils (tested with 0.4)
- Jinja (tested with 1.0)
- Pygments (tested with 7.1)

For the curious: the contents of our site at http://pybtex.sourceforge.net/
are generated as follows:

$ ./generate.py site

Can you see the difference? ;)
