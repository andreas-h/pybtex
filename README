How to use pybtex? It is not too usable at the moment. You may
want to examine the test subdirectory and do the following:

$ latex foo.tex # to produce foo.aux file

$ ../pybtex.py foo.bib # to produce foo.bbl file

After that examine foo.bbl file to see what you have just got.
Than build a dvi:

$ latex foo.tex

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us
by email (see AUTHORS file).
